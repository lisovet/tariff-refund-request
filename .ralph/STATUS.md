## Last completed task

**#69 — Footnotes, signed footer, disclosures**

Extracted the canonical disclosure strings into a shared, JSX-free module (`src/shared/disclosure/constants.ts`) so the Readiness Report PDF + email templates + Next UI all import from one source. `src/app/_components/ui/Disclosure.tsx` + `src/shared/infra/email/templates/_layout.tsx` re-exported / re-imported accordingly.

Three new PDF components:

1. **`SignOffBlock.tsx`** — the analyst reviewing-attribution block per the disclosure rule (*"Readiness Report… always names the validator and timestamp"*). Paper-toned card with ink border, GT Sectra analyst name, Berkeley Mono timestamp, and the validator's note. Empty-note case renders an italic fallback — no Readiness Report ships without attribution.
2. **`Footnotes.tsx`** + **`FootnoteMarker`** — numbered footnotes at the end of the body (`[1]`, `[2]`...) referenced inline via `FootnoteMarker({ index })`. Real text — no circled-digit glyphs that break screen readers.
3. **`DisclosureFooter.tsx`** — the per-page fixed footer block now renders four lines verbatim from the shared disclosure module: "Not legal advice" eyebrow, `SUBMISSION_CONTROL_CLAUSE`, `CANONICAL_TRUST_PROMISE`, and `NOT_LEGAL_ADVICE_DISCLOSURE`. Old `<Text fixed>` one-line footer retired.

`ReadinessReportBody` gained two optional fields: `signoff: SignOffBlockProps` + `footnotes: FootnoteItem[]`. `ReadinessReportDoc` composes them after the prerequisites list.

Test suite additions: `src/shared/disclosure/__tests__/constants.test.ts` (6 tests freezing the four canonical strings) + `src/contexts/cape/report-pdf/__tests__/footer-sections.test.ts` (16 tests: SignOffBlock attribution + timestamp + note paths, FootnoteMarker numeric + multi-digit, Footnotes ordering + verbatim body + empty case, DisclosureFooter verbatim on three clauses, full integration tree-walk asserting the canonical promise + sign-off + timestamp appear in the report).

The tree-walk helper was upgraded to invoke pure function-components inline so tests can traverse the full composed tree (react-pdf components don't execute until render).

838/838 pass.

## Previously completed this wave

**#68 — Hero metric + entry table + prerequisites**

Three PDF-body components under `src/contexts/cape/report-pdf/`:

1. **`HeroMetric.tsx`** — GT Sectra 28pt "N entries reviewed" hero line + three Berkeley-Mono badges (blocking / warnings / info). State-color tokens: blocking `#8A1F1F`, warning `#7A5A1A`, positive `#1D6B3C`. Zero-count badges tint positive; non-zero tint by severity — meaning-bearing color per DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md.
2. **`EntryTable.tsx`** — Flex-row typeset table (no DOM `<table>` in react-pdf). Columns: status glyph / entry number / date / IOR / duty USD (right-aligned, Berkeley Mono tabular figures). Rows with notes render a secondary indented row under each data row. Exports frozen `STATUS_GLYPHS = { ok: '○', warning: '△', blocking: '×' }` — real Unicode, no emoji, assistive-tech-readable.
3. **`PrerequisitesList.tsx`** — Hairline-separated list of `PrerequisiteCheck` with ✓ / ✕ markers (green / red) + right-aligned "Met" / "Missing" mono label.

`ReadinessReportDoc.tsx` extended: new `ReadinessReportBody` prop (totalEntries / blockingCount / warningCount / infoCount / entryRows / prerequisites). When `body` is supplied the three sections render in order; when omitted, the masthead-only scaffold from #67 still renders (backwards-compatible).

10 new component tests (`body-sections.test.ts`) + 2 new integration tests (`report.test.ts` — full-body render yields >1.5KB buffer + tree-walk asserts disclosure still appears). Total PDF tests: 19.

816/816 pass.

## New task added this iteration

**#401 — AI-assist marketing copy + explainer modules across funnel**

Post-v1 (id > 86) growth task capturing the user's mandate to surface "how the platform uses AI to maximize an importer's IEEPA refund" across the funnel without breaking the trust posture. Eight placements: homepage AI section, /how-it-works AI stage, /cape-prep AI value strip, screener-results AI-confidence line, Readiness Report PDF "How we reviewed" paragraph, engagement-letter AI clause, /trust AI disclosure, two transactional-email lines. Constraints: every surface names the human-validator-final gate; no AI-copy clichés; every claim backed by a real code path. Depends on #14, #15, #17, #24, #68, #72.

## Human-verification still owes

- Drop licensed GT Sectra + Söhne + Berkeley Mono TTFs into `public/fonts/` and update `fonts.ts` to register them.
- Eyeball a rendered PDF with a real 100-entry broker fixture once #69 layers in the sign-off block.

## Next eligible

Per dependency check (v1 only):
- Task #70 — deps satisfied (69 done). **Eligible — lowest id.** (Artifact generation pipeline + R2 storage.)
- Task #72 — eligible.
- Task #74 — eligible.
- Task #75 — eligible.
- Task #77 — eligible.

Lowest-id eligible is **task #70**.

## Notes

- 69/86 v1 done — 80.2% of Phase 0.
- Post-v1 backlog includes AI-copy funnel task #401.
- Loop will continue with #70 next iteration.
